# Who’s it for?

LMOS is designed for individuals and organizations aiming to develop a individual agents and then evolve from individual AI agents to an integrated, multi-agent system. This includes:

- **Developers**: Those who want to create individual AI agents and then seek to unify them into a cohesive system.

- **Companies**: Organizations looking to connect AI agents developed by various departments to enhance collaboration.

- **Collaborative Companies**: Multiple organizations working together, desiring a platform that facilitates seamless integration of their AI agents.

*Example Scenario*:

Consider a company that initially created a customer service chatbot to handle basic inquiries. As the company grows, it develops specialized AI agents to handle different areas of customer interaction, such as frequently asked questions, billing inquiries, order-related issues, sales offers, technical support, and general knowledge queries. While these agents are developed independently to focus on their specific tasks, they need to work together seamlessly to ensure a smooth and efficient customer experience. With LMOS, all these agents, whether created by different teams in different languages or even different companies, can be integrated into a single unified system. They can share data, collaborate on tasks, and communicate with each other, making the entire system more efficient, flexible, and scalable.

**Summary:**
LMOS makes it easy to connect these diverse agents, allowing organizations to manage them together as a single unit, regardless of the tools, frameworks, or languages used to build each one. Whether you're working on a small-scale project or a large enterprise-level deployment, LMOS helps you build a connected, interoperable network of intelligent agents that can grow and evolve alongside your needs.
