# Security & Privacy Considerations

Security and privacy in the LMOS Protocol is aligned with the principles and best practices outlined in the Web of Things (WoT) architecture. 

## Key Security Principles

1. **Authentication and Authorization**:  
      - Ensure that all agents and tools interacting through LMOS are authenticated, and access is granted based on clearly defined permissions.
      - Use token-based or certificate-based mechanisms, following WoTâ€™s best practices. 
      - W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) can also be utilized as a method for digital identities, providing secure, verifiable, and self-sovereign authentication.

2. **Data Confidentiality and Integrity**:  
      - All communications must use secure transport protocols (e.g., HTTPS, WebSockets over TLS) to protect data from interception and tampering.
      - Adopt mechanisms such as digital signatures or encryption to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of data exchanged between agents.

3.  **Access Control**: 
      - Restrict access to sensitive data based on scopes.
