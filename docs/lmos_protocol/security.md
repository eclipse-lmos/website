# Security & Privacy Considerations

Security & Privacy in the LMOS Protocol is aligned with the principles and best practices outlined in the Web of Things (WoT) Architecture. The WoT Security & Privacy Considerations, as defined by the W3C, provide a comprehensive framework to ensure secure interactions within interconnected "Things".

## Key Security Principles

1. **Authentication and Authorization**:  
      - Ensure that all agents and tools interacting through LMOS are authenticated, and access is granted based on clearly defined permissions.
      - Use token-based or certificate-based mechanisms, following WoTâ€™s best practices.

2. **Data Confidentiality and Integrity**:  
      - All communications must use secure transport protocols (e.g., HTTPS, WebSockets over TLS) to protect data from interception and tampering.
      - Adopt mechanisms such as digital signatures or encryption to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of data exchanged between agents.

3. **Privacy and Data Minimization**:  
      - Collect and store only the data that is essential for operation, adhering to principles of data minimization.
      - Ensure compliance with privacy standards (e.g., GDPR) by implementing clear policies for data retention, anonymization, and user consent.

4.  **Access Control**: 
      - Restrict access to sensitive data based on scopes.
