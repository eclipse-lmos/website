# Agent Registry

## Problem statement

A centralized Agent Registry is necessary, serving as a repository where agents can register themselves and query information about other registered agents. This would facilitate easy discovery and integration across networks.

An Agent registry is essential for several reasons:
* **Discovery and Integration:** The registry serves as a centralized repository where agents can register themselves and query information about other registered agents. This facilitates easy discovery and integration of agents across different networks and systems.
* **Metadata Management:** The registry stores and manages agent metadata, including capabilities, API endpoints, and resource requirements. This allows other agents to find and utilize specific functionalities offered by registered agents.
* **Dynamic Updates:** As agents' capabilities or status change, they can update their metadata in the registry. This ensures that the latest information about each agent is always available to the rest of the system.
* **Cross-Network Communication:** The registry enables agents to discover and interact with other agents across different networks or domains, facilitating broader collaboration and interoperability.
* **Version Control:** The registry can store version information for each agent, helping to manage updates and ensure compatibility between different agent versions.
* **Security Management:** A centralized registry can implement and enforce security policies, ensuring that only authorized agents can discover certain agents.

## Web of Things

A Thing Directory in  [W3C Web of Things (WoT)](https://www.w3.org/WoT/) serves as a centralized registry for Thing Descriptions (TDs). It plays a crucial role in enabling discovery and management of WoT things across network boundaries. 

### Purpose and Functionality

1. **Centralized Registry:**
   The Thing Directory acts as a centralized database where Thing Descriptions can be stored, retrieved, and managed.

2. **Discovery Enablement:**
   It facilitates the discovery of Things by allowing clients to search for and retrieve TDs based on various criteria.

### Core Features

1. **TD Storage:**
   Stores Thing Descriptions in a structured format, typically using databases or triple stores for efficient querying.

2. **Search Capabilities:**
   Offers various search mechanisms, including:
   - Endpoint-based lookup
   - Resource-based lookup
   - Semantic queries (often using SPARQL)
   - JSON-LD frame-based searches

3. **Validation:**
   Can perform validation of submitted TDs against the W3C WoT Thing Description specification.
